### Running the tests on Android

The tests are meant to be run on an Android phone. The apk is provided in this repository, under the `app/` folder.

`./start_tests_Mac.sh`
or
`./start_tests_Windows.sh`


This script will:
- try to uninstall the apk and reinstall it
- try to create a python virtual env and install the dependencies
- run the tests
